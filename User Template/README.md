### 🧩 How to Add Users Using Department-Based Templates in Office 365

In environments where multiple departments (like IT, HR, Finance, etc.) require different user roles and settings, using **user templates** ensures consistency and speeds up the onboarding process.

This section will show you how to:
- Create a predefined user template
- Use that template to add users efficiently
- Apply department-specific licenses, settings, and roles

#### 🛠️ Step 1: Begin Template Setup

Navigate to the **"Add user"** section and start creating a new user. In the **Setup basics** screen, define template settings that reflect the department needs.
