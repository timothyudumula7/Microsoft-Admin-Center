### ü§ù Creating Guest Users in Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD)

In Microsoft 365, **guest users** can only be added via **Microsoft Entra ID** (formerly Azure Active Directory). These users are external collaborators ‚Äî often contractors, partners, or vendors ‚Äî who need limited access to internal resources.

In this example, we demonstrate:
- Navigating to Entra ID
- Adding guest users by **manual creation** and **email invitation**
- Verifying their presence in the directory

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Step 1: Navigate to Entra ID

From the **Microsoft 365 Admin Center**, go to **Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD)**.  
You can choose to either:
- **Invite** a guest via email  
- Or **manually create** a guest profile

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Step 2: Manually Create Guest User ‚Äì Kim Green

We manually create a guest user named **Kim Green** by filling out her profile in Entra ID.

#### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Step 4: View All Guest Users

After both methods are used, you can now see:
- **Kim Green** (manually created)
- **Chris** (added via invitation)

Both are visible under the **"Users > Guest users"** tab in Entra ID.
