## 🛡️ Creating and Assigning a Policy for the HR Department

In this section, we’ll walk through how to **create a custom policy** (for example, a Teams messaging or meeting policy), **add team members**, **configure settings**, and finally **assign it to the HR department group**.

---

### 📋 Step 1: Create a New HR Policy

Start by creating a new policy in the Microsoft 365 Admin Center (or Teams Admin Center, depending on policy type).

- Go to **Teams Admin Center** → **Policy section** (Messaging/Meeting/Calling etc.)
- Click **Add** or **Create** to make a new policy.
- Name it something like `"HR Messaging Policy"` or `"HR Meeting Restrictions"`.

### ⚙️ Step 2: Configure the Policy Settings

Define the rules and settings specific to the HR department:
- Restrict or allow chat, GIFs, private calls, screen sharing, etc.
- Set meeting behavior, lobby rules, or external sharing.

Be sure to **Save** once done.

### 👥 Step 3: Assign the Policy to HR Group

Now that the policy is created, go to:
- **Users → Groups** (or directly to the Teams Admin Center → Manage Teams)
- Select the **HR group**
- Assign the policy from the dropdown menu or settings tab

### ✅ Summary

| Task                         | Location                                 |
|------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Create policy                | Teams Admin Center → Policy Type         |
| Customize policy settings    | In the policy editor                     |
