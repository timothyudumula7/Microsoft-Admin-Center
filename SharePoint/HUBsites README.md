## 🏢 Creating and Associating SharePoint Hub Sites

A **SharePoint Hub Site** lets you organize multiple SharePoint sites under a shared navigation and branding structure. This is especially helpful for grouping related sites like HR, Marketing, and Training into a centralized portal.

### 🔨 Step 1: Create a New SharePoint Site

We begin by creating another site for the **HR Marketing** team:

> ![Create another SharePoint site](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c9693ae7-3cbe-42f3-8102-2bed8584b47e)
> ![Site name is HR Marketing](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f3a9f734-e8e4-41e3-af90-4ba112c8aebb)
> ![Create it](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/570a5353-0d7a-44be-b97c-33c984f650e9)

### 🧱 Step 2: Register the Hub Site

Next, we register the **HR Training** site as a Hub Site:

1. Go to the SharePoint admin center.
2. Select the site (e.g., **HR Training**).
3. Click **"Register as Hub Site"**.

> ![Register HR Training as a Hub Site](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fdc96459-8d78-432a-b5d6-1be70f771b14)
> ![Name the hub site and assign admins](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9c5643d7-6734-4b19-8c3a-7232486a1067)

---

### 🔗 Step 3: Associate a Site with the Hub

Now we associate the new **HR Marketing** site to the **HR Training** Hub:

1. Open the **HR Marketing** site.
2. Select **"Site Information" > "Hub site association"**.
3. Choose **HR Training** from the dropdown.

> ![Click on HR Marketing and associate it](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8c4093b9-1b5f-4607-84e1-115174fea69f)
> ![Select the HR training site](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/101884c0-d17f-4167-abe3-eb542374728d)

---

### ✅ Result

- **Unified Navigation:** Both HR Marketing and HR Training now share a common hub navigation bar.
- **Consistent Branding:** The branding from the Hub applies to all associated sites.
- **Scalability:** You can now associate more departmental sites (e.g., HR Finance, HR Events) to this Hub.

## 💡 Tips

- Only admins can register a site as a hub.
- Use hub sites to reflect company structure (e.g., HR, IT, Operations).
- Permissions are still managed per site even when linked to a hub.
