# Microsoft 365 Administration Documentation

This repository serves as a working documentation space for Microsoft 365 administration tasks.

It includes step-by-step guides, annotated screenshots, and references for actions performed across services like SharePoint, Teams, Azure AD, Exchange, and Microsoft 365 Groups. These notes are meant to assist IT support staff, system administrators, and anyone managing the Microsoft 365 environment through the admin portals.

The purpose is not to be an exhaustive guide, but to document real-world admin procedures as they are carried out‚Äîmaking it easier to troubleshoot, repeat, or hand off tasks.

All visual references are captured from the admin center for clarity. This documentation will evolve as more admin workflows are added or updated.
